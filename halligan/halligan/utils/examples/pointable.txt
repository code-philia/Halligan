```python
def solve(frames: list[Frame]) -> None:
    # First, annotate a part of frame with keypoints
    # Each keypoint is a number in the image
    # Be mindful of ambiguous instructions, as phrases like 'end of the car's path' refers to the car's destination, not where the car is
    keypoint_image = frames[0].show_keypoints(region="bottom")

    # Next, ask questions related to task
    # Note: frames are illegal, PIL.Images only
    answer = ask([keypoint_image], "point to the largest animal", answer_type="int")

    # Get the Point corresponding to the number answer
    keypoint = frames[0].get_keypoint(id=answer[0])

    # Get the surrounding Points
    neighbour_image = keypoint.show_neighbours()

    # Secondary refinement
    refined_answer = ask([neighbour_image], "point to the largest animal", answer_type="int")

    # Get the Point corresponding to the number answer
    keypoint = keypoint.get_neighbour(id=refined_answer[0])

    # Finally, point to the keypoint
    point(to=keypoint)

    # Hint: Be mindful of ambiguous instructions, as phrases like "end of the car's path" 
    # might refer to the path's endpoint rather than the car's rear.

    # Hint: show_keypoints() is necessary before get_keypoint()
