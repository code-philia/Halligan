Halligan is a vision-language model (VLM) agent designed to solve visual CAPTCHA challenges. It is published in *"Are CAPTCHAs Still Bot-hard? Generalized Visual CAPTCHA Solving with Agentic Vision Language Model"* (USENIX Security'25)

## Environment

- **Hardware Dependencies:** We tested the functionality on a desktop computer with 16GB of GPU VRAM (Optional), 8GB of system RAM, and 16GB of available disk space.

- **Software Dependencies:** We recommend using Linux. Our setup was tested on Ubuntu 20.04.3 LTS with Pixi 0.47.0, CUDA 12.1 (Optional), Docker 24.0.7, and Docker Compose 2.21.0.

## Setup

1. Install [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) and [Pixi](https://pixi.sh/dev/installation/).

2. Run the benchmark server and browser using Docker:

    ```bash
    cd benchmark
    docker compose up
    ```

3. To setup Halligan, setup the Pixi environment in `/halligan`. Then, download the models used in Halligan. Finally, edit the .env file to include your OpenAI API key and other relevant credentials.

    ```bash
    cd halligan
    pixi install
    bash get_models.sh
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

## Usage

1. (Sanity Check) Verify that the benchmark, browser, and Halliganâ€™s core components are all functional:

    ```bash
    pixi run pytest basic_test.py --verbose
    ```

2. (Generate CAPTCHA Solution Scripts) This will run Halligan to generate Python solutions for 26 types of CAPTCHAs. Output is saved to `/results/generation`.

    ```bash
    pixi run python generate.py
    ```

3. (Execute the Solutions) This will run the generated solutions and demonstrate Halligan solving the CAPTCHAs. Results are saved to `/results/execution`.

    ```
    pixi run python execute.py
    ```
